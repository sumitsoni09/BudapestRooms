Oct. 11th, 2018: Demonstrating heroku hosting with express

Oct. 11, 2018: I started on creating an idea for a hotel where a user can change a room that was given to them to their own personal choice, but came to another conclusion where a customer/user can make a room more of a home for themself by selecting what type of furniture they would like to have and the size of the room but at a fixed price for the size of the room and get to name their room. Started working on the 7 restful routes and made sure that each page got linked from index>show>index, and index>new>index. 

Oct. 12, 2018: started to work on the database to finish using the CRUD method as well as the 7 restful routes in the server. 

Oct. 13, 2018: modified the server a bit and got it to work on heroku, if you follow my commits you will see the transitions.
